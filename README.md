# Catalan Comarques Loader

The Catalan Comarques extension for CiviCRM allows an easy method to load all the
counties (comarques) in Catalaonia.  This extension is based in the US Counties
extension by Andie Hunt.

## Using the extension

Enabling the extension runs the county loader, which loads all the counties in
each province of Catalonia if they aren't already in your database.  From that
point, the extension does nothing.  You can even disable the extension, and the
counties will stay there.  Uninstalling the extension also does nothing, for an
important reason: it could cause data loss by deleting data stored in addresses.
